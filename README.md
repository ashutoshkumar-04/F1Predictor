Formula One Win Probability Prediction
This project is a web application built using Python's Flask framework and machine learning techniques
to predict the win probability of a Formula One race.
The application takes in two inputs - top speed and grid position - and uses a machine learning model to predict the probability of a particular driver winning the race.


Dataset
The machine learning model used in this project was trained on a dataset of Formula One race results 

Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a logistic regression model. The model was trained using the scikit-learn library in Python. The accuracy of the model is approximately 75%, as measured on a holdout set of data.
